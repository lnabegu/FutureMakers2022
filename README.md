# FutureMakers2022

**Day 1 Reflection**: Today, I reviewed basic concepts in Python as well as learned about functions that are typically used in machine learning. In addition to that, I worked with NumPy and Pandas. I found it really challenging at first to navigate the dense documentation, but it has been fulfilling to become more comfortable reading it. 

**Day 2 Reflection**: I covered basic machine learning concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. I was also introduced to the different libraries that are used in machine learning. Finally, I got experience making random forests and I tested out the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to classify irises. 

**Day 3 Reflection**: This day I explored different types of linear machine learning models such as linear regression, clustering, and perceptrons. I also started playing around with Tensorflow and creating neural networks.

**Day 4 Reflection**: Today, I explored TensorFlow in more depth. I saw how a basic fashion dataset could be preprocessed and used in a neural network.
