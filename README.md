# FutureMakers2022

**Day 1 Reflection**: Today, I reviewed basic concepts in Python as well as learned about functions that are typically used in machine learning. In addition to that, I worked with NumPy and Pandas. I found it really challenging at first to navigate the dense documentation, but it has been fulfilling to become more comfortable reading it. 

**Day 2 Reflection**: I covered basic machine learning concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. I was also introduced to the different libraries that are used in machine learning. Finally, I got experience making random forests and I tested out the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to classify irises. 

**Day 3 Reflection**: This day I explored different types of linear machine learning models such as linear regression, clustering, and perceptrons. I also started playing around with Tensorflow and creating neural networks.

**Day 4 Reflection**: Today, I explored TensorFlow in more depth. I saw how a basic fashion dataset could be preprocessed and used in a neural network.

**Day 5 Reflection**: Today, I used a neural network coded up by scratch to understand the mathematics behind it. To be honest, I will definitely need to research it a bit more with Youtube videos/online articles, but it was cool to learn about forward and backpropagation, as well as stochastic gradient descent. I also realized how much Tensorflow simplifies machine learning today!

**Day 6 Reflection**: I learned about convolutional networks, filtering, and max-pooling in this day. It was cool to explore how coding can be used to modify images so that they can be processed more easily by a machine learning algorithm.

**Day 7 Reflection**: I played a game that taught me about bias in hiring algorithms that utilize AI. It really showed me how easy it is for subconscious biases can lead to algorithms acting in unintended ways.
